</strong></p><p><strong>Science is a powerful means of understanding the world in which we live and it is also capable of yielding enormous returns that directly enhance socio-economic development and the quality of our lives. Scientific advances over the last five decades have led to revolutionary changes in technology, health, nutrition and communication. Moreover, the role of science promises to be yet greater in the future because of ever-more-rapid scientific progress.Meanwhile, humanity is being confronted with problems on a global scale, many - such as environmental degradation, pollution and climatic change - provoked by the mismanagement of natural resources or unsustainable production and consumption patterns. Even if the technology implicated in these problems can be said to have stemmed from science, we cannot hope to resolve these problems without the correct and timely use of science in the future. And yet, in spite of the opportunities it offers us all, science itself is facing wavering confidence and uncertain investment, as well as dilemmas of an ethical nature. These problems can only be solved if the scientific and business communities, governments and the general public are able to reach, through debate, a common ground on science with respect to the service it is to provide to society and a new commitment to science from society in the years to come. 
</strong></p><p><strong>In convening an “International Web Conference on Recent Advances in Science (IWCRAS 2020)”: a new commitment, on 30th – 31st July, 2020, Department of Physics and Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC), Don Bosco College, Tura, Meghalaya in co-operation with nine other partners will provide a unique forum for this much-needed interactions between the scientific experts and the students. The target participants are Post Graduate (PG) students, Researchers and Academicians of all branches of Science. 
</strong></p><p><strong>The Conference addressed and involved state governments and institutions, educational and research establishments, members of the scientific community, the business sector, various societies and international scientific academicians, as well as the media and the general public. All stakeholders with a vested interest in science and its role in societal development are welcome as active participants in the web conference process by means of free registration by clicking a link and filling up a simple form. All participants and presenters will get an e-certificate after filling up the feedback forms on both the days. The feedback form will be given on the live platform in which the web conference will be organized. 
</strong></p><p><strong>This web conference will be a unique for the host college as it for the first time that an international web conference will be organized by the college and that too the participants will be able to present quality talk from the findings in their research in all branches of science. Also, it is a matter of great pride that altogether nine collaborators will be there with the host college. An e-abstract of the conference will also be published.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><strong>Don Bosco College, Tura, is the Salesian response to the higher educational need of the young people of Garo Hills in particular and north-east India in general. With the mandate from the Salesian Provincial and his Council of Guwahati, Rev. Fr Antony Buccieri purchased a plot of land meant for the College. Preparatory works for the establishment of a College was entrusted to Rev. Fr George Karipaparampil. In 1986, Fr George came to stay in the community of Don Bosco School, Tura for the purpose. 
</strong><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>As a result of the meticulous work of Fr George, the North Eastern Hill University (NEHU) granted permission to begin Don Bosco College, Tura on 5 November 1986. Rev. Fr John Kalapura, the then Provincial, constituted the first Governing Board of the College on 3 January 1987. Rev. Fr Cyriac Vettickathadam was appointed the first Principal of the College. The classes began on 21 April 1987. The official inauguration of the College took place on 22 May 1987. Most Rev. George Mamalassery, the then Bishop of Tura blessed the College and Mr Purno A. Sangma, the then Union Minister for Labour, officially inaugurated it. 
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Initially the College offered Pre-University and Degree courses in Arts. The classes were held in the Boys’ Hostel building of the Sacred Heart Parish, Tura. Some boys were also taken into the hostel in 1987. In the following year, after prolonged discussions and discernment, the College was opened to girls. The Salesian Sisters agreed to look after the hostel for the girls. 
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>In 1993, the classes were shifted to the hostel buildings constructed at Sampalgre. In the successive years, the College began other courses science at Pre-University and degree levels.  Honours courses both in B.A. and B.Sc. were also added. Later, degree courses in commerce, Business Administration (BBA) and Computer Applications (BCA) were introduced.  
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>In 2001, the College was shifted from the hostel to its permanent campus. The infrastructure of the College consists of the Academic complex, hostels and staff quarters. The College has an impressive amphitheatre-a multipurpose facility comprising of a basketball court and canteens. The Salesian presence at the College was formally recognized as a Salesian community in 2002 with Fr Cyriac Vettickathadam as its first Rector. During the tenure of Fr Cyriac, a large plot of land was purchased where rubber was planted. Besides offering the students research facilities, the rubber garden supports the College financially. When Fr Cyriac was transferred in 2011, Fr Alex Kattakayam was appointed Principal of the College.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>The College functions through a collaborative venture in which various College Committees and Students’ Welfare Association participate. The Counselling Centre at the College renders personal counselling as well as imparts career counselling and value education. The College has the units of NCC and NSS. It promotes academic excellence by offering scholarships/free-ships to meritorious students. The College has an I.A.S. Study Circle where coaching is given for Central and State civil service examinations and for entrance examinations in Management, Engineering, Medicine, etc. The Study Circle is supported by the State government and is open also to the public. The Campus Ministry at the College cares for the spiritual welfare of the students by organizing Mass for the Catholic students on first Fridays, holding conferences and conducting Bible classes for hostel students, etc. The College choir makes the religious services more attractive and prayerful.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>The College, thus, lays great emphasis on an education that is participatory in nature, intellectually competent, multi-skill oriented, value based and socially committed. True to the Motto ‘Pursuit of Excellence’, the College is passionate about excellence in every sphere, academic, professional, social and personal. In 2012, the College went for NAAC accreditation and was awarded B+ Grade with CGPA score of 2.45 on four-point scale. In the year 2017, two new departments were introduced BA Sociology and BA Geography. The College is contemplating on introducing BSW and BSc Computer Science. The College is also preparing for NAAC reaccreditation. In 2019, the Salesian community consists of Rev. Fr Bivan Rodriques Mukhim (Rector and Principal, Degree College), Fr Zachary Varickasseril (Vice Rector and Principal, B. Ed. College), Fr Louis Arimboor (Administrator) and Fr Albinus Dhanwar (Vice Principal).
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>In the last 32 years, Don Bosco College has distinguished itself as one of the premier Colleges in Garo Hills. It is the endeavour of everyone at Don Bosco College to keep the flag aloft and continue its tradition of pursuit of excellence and quality of service.
